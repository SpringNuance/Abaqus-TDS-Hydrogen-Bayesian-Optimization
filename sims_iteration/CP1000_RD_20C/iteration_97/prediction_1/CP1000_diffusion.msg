          THERE IS ZERO HEAT FLUX EVERYWHERE
 

 ***WARNING: THERE IS ZERO HEAT FLUX EVERYWHERE IN THE MODEL BASED ON THE 
             DEFAULT CRITERION. PLEASE CHECK THE VALUE OF THE AVERAGE HEAT FLUX 
             DURING THE CURRENT ITERATION TO VERIFY THAT THE HEAT FLUX IS SMALL 
             ENOUGH TO BE TREATED AS ZERO. IF NOT, PLEASE USE THE SOLUTION 
             CONTROLS TO RESET THE CRITERION FOR ZERO HEAT FLUX.
